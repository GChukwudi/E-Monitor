#### 3. **Credit Exhaustion & Relay Control Testing**

**Scenario**: Simulated complete credit depletion

**Test Procedure**:
1. Set remaining credit to 0 kWh in Firebase
2. Observe system behavior
3. Verify relay state and power disconnection

**Results**:
```
14:19:34.957 → ⚠️ Relay OFF - Not deducting energy
14:19:34.957 → ========================================
14:19:35.561 → Relay State: OFF | Remaining: 0.00 kWh
14:19:41.063 → Relay State: OFF | Remaining: 0.00 kWh
14:19:46.670 → Relay State: OFF | Remaining: 0.00 kWh
[...continuous OFF state maintained...]
```

![Relay OFF State](screenshots/relay-off-credit-exhausted.png)

**Key Observations**:
- ✅ Relay switched to OFF state
- ✅ System continues monitoring but does NOT deduct energy
- ✅ Clear warning message: "Relay OFF - Not deducting energy"
- ✅ Persistent OFF state maintained across multiple reading cycles

**Credit Restoration Test**:
```
19:27:10.219 → ✓ Remaining units from Firebase: 11.39 kWh
19:27:10.219 → ✓ RELAY ON - Power flowing to unit
19:27:10.219 → Relay State: ON | Remaining: 11.39 kWh
```

- ✅ System immediately detects restored credit
- ✅ Relay automatically switches to ON
- ✅ Normal operation resumes
- ✅ Energy deduction recommences

**Relay Control Summary**:
| Credit Level | Relay State | Energy Deduction | Power Flow |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| > 0 kWh | ON | ✅ Yes | ✅ Active |
| = 0 kWh | OFF | ❌ No | ❌ Disconnected |
